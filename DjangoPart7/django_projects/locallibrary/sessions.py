""""Saving session data"""

# This is detected as an update to the session, so session data is saved.

"""
If you're updating some information within session data, then Django will not recognize that you've made a change to the session and save the data (for example,
if you were to change "wheels" data inside your "my_car" data, as shown below). In this case you will need to explicitly mark the session as having been modified.
"""
# Session object not directly modified, only data within the session. Session changes not saved!
request.session['my_car']['wheels'] = 'alloy'

# Set session as modified to force data updates/cookie to be saved.

"""Simple example â€” getting visit counts
As a simple real-world example we'll update our library to tell the current user how many times they have visited the LocalLibrary home page.

Open /locallibrary/catalog/views.py, and add the lines that contain num_visits into index() (as shown below)."""
